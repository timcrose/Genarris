Purpose
-------
Identifies all unique molecules in a structure and performs a 
reconstruction of the structure using whole molecules. These
reconstructed geometries are denoted as "rstruct". Most of the 
time, molecular bonds of molecules in CIF files are satisfied 
by periodic boundary conditions. However, sometimes it becomes
more convenient to have all molecular bonds satisfied directly. 


Requirements 
------------
1. Anaconda3 and Pytorch. Pytorch can be downloaded and installed
   from here: https://pytorch.org. Typically settings will be to 
   select the stable Pytorch Build, select your OS, select Conda, 
   Python3, CUDA as None, then run the provided command. 
2. Newest version of ibslib installed from:
   https://github.com/manny405/ibslib
   Install the package with:
   python setup.py install


Instructions
------------
1. Make sure the newest version of ibslib is installed from Github  
2. Open ibslib_whole_molecules.py script and read the description of 
   the variables and functions used. 
3. Modify variables as necessary. Modify struct_file to change target 
   structure to find whole molecules. Modify output_format for the
   structures to be output as different file types.  
4. Run: python ibslib_whole_molecules.py
5. Visualize the difference between structures from the original CSD 
   file and the rstruct using jmol. It should be obvious what the 
   script has done. 


Troubleshooting
---------------
Any errors will typically be due to using previous versions of 
ibslib. Redownaload and reinstall and try again. 


Files in the directory
----------------------
TETCEN.cif - CIF file from the CSD for tetracene
TETCEN_original.in - Geometry file of TETCEN.cif for visualization using jmol
ibslib_whole_molecules.py - Script for finding molecules and reconstructing 
                            the geometry using whole molecules.
